1. How will you test the changes?
An intermediate/sandbox environment is used to test the changes in the cluster, this is required to avoid corruption of the currently running system.
Once test is successful the changes are promoted to production. This should be incorporated in SDLC process.

2. How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?
The change should be tested in a non-production cluster. Once the change is applied, you should monitor metrics using your observability and monitoring techniques like Prometheus and Grafana.
Logs and traces can also be collected to troubleshoot efficiently
