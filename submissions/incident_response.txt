1. Incident:
    Suspiciuous CPU activity results in a cryptomining attack

2. Summary of what happened:
    Three pods running different crypto miners were identified running moneropool, minergate and cryptonight containers.
    An attacker was able to get control of the cluster and use compute resources to abuse for crypto-mining.
    The Falco monitoring runtime reports the incident and the administrator was able to visualize the suspicious activity in Grafana.

3. Identification Process:
    Monitoring of CPU utilization spikes in Grafana.

4. Summary of what was affected:
    CPU resources had a significant spike indicating that attackers made use of compute resources.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
    - Kill pods kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force
    - Verify if CPU activity is stabilized

6. Root Cause
    Hacker was able to access kubectl command and initialized the pods

7. Summary of lessons learned:
    - We should review access to the Kubernetes API server from administrative terminals and the Grafana dashboards.
    - Admission controllers can also be configured to disallow unknown images to be used to create containers.
    - Access to be given to specofuc users and with permissions limited to certain resources in kubernetes
